My API Project, also named AyyBnE on its site, is made to present my knowledge of full stack development, featuring a working database in the backend as well as a functional and presentable frontend to work with it. The back and front ends are made using SQL and React respectively.

# Getting Started

To run on the Render server, simply follow this link: https://saads-auth-me.onrender.com

To run the project locally, open in VSC at the 'authenticate-me' folder. Then, open two terminals, cd into the frontend folder on the first, and into the backend folder on the second. 
Use the following commands for the respective terminals:
```
cd frontend
npm install
```
```
cd backend
npm install
```

Afterwards type the following into the backend terminal, and then into the frontend terminal after to run the application locally on your browser:
```
npm start
```
